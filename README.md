# Blockzy: Your Gateway to Immersive Ethereum Proof-of-Stake Simulation

Blockzy is a blockchain explorer that allows users to view real-time blockchain data, including transactions, blocks, and Ethereum price. The platform offers functionalities such as starting transactions, staking ETH, and managing Ethereum wallets.

This whole project works on custom blockchain that was built using `Javascript` to simulate the original `Proof-of-Stake` mechanism of Ethereum blockchain.

The Project aims to provide a simplified `UI+UX` for a end user to be able to understand the working and familiarize themselves with the blockchain technology and proof-of-stake mechanism

## Features
- View latest Ethereum blocks and transactions.
- Ethereum price and market cap tracking.
- Wallet management and staking ETH.
- Become a validator node.
- Start and confirm transactions on the blockchain.
